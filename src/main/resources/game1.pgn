1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Bc5 5.Nb3 ( { Kasparov tended to favour } 5.Be3 { or 5 Nxc6 but his protege prefers this slightly quieter treatment. Some would say innocuous - it doesn't pose Black any particular problems. } ) 5...Bb6 6.Nc3 ( { Carlsen played } 6.Qe2 { in four games at the World Blitz Championship in November 2009 but in a 'real game' he prefers something more mainstream... } ) 6...Nf6 { [diagram] } 7.Qe2 $5 { [... or does he? This seems to have been played first by the 11-year-old Sergey Karjakin, and not very successfully at that. To date it has not had a poor track record in terms of results scored. Added to his dubious opening experiments at the Olympiad, further questions might have been asked of Carlsen's state of mind had this game gone awry, but this proves to be one of his more inspired ideas.] } 7...O-O ( { The solid } 7...d6 { has scored well for Black, with } 8.Bg5 h6 9.Bh4 { and now } 9...g5 { being a possibility as Black has yet to castle kingside. } ) 8.Bg5 h6 9.Bh4 ( 9.h4 $6 d6 10.f3 $2 hxg5 11.hxg5 Ng4 $1 { (anything else and White will play g4 followed by Qh5) } 12.fxg4 Qxg5 13.Qf3 Bxg4 { and Black already had a winning position in the game Rublevsky-Anand, Bastia Rapidplay 2004. } ) 9...a5 10.a4 Nd4 11.Qd3 $1 ( { Carlsen's judgement, that the forthcoming doubled pawns on the b-file will be less weakening than on the c-file (after } 11.Nxd4 Bxd4 { and 12...Bxc3), proves to be spot on. } ) 11...Nxb3 12.cxb3 Re8 13.O-O-O { White signalled his intention to castle queenside as soon as he played 7 Qe2. His pressure along the d-file and h4-d8 diagonal compensate for the structural weakness of his queenside. } 13...d6 14.Qc2 Bd7 $6 ( 14...c6 { looks more natural, depriving White of the use of b5 and d5 for his minor pieces. } ) 15.Bc4 Be6 ( { Moving this piece twice alongside the same diagonal gives the impression that Bacrot is unsure of himself. Perhaps he intended } 15...Bc6 { but then feared an imminent g-pawn advance by White. Whatever his thinking, we can adapt the old proverb and conclude "he who hesitates (when playing Black against Carlsen) is lost". } ) 16.Rhe1 ( 16.e5 $2 { would cost White a pawn after } 16...Bxc4 { and a capture on e5 but now the e-pawn advance becomes a real threat. } ) 16...Qe7 ( { Black's option was to be brave and try } 16...g5 { to drive away the annoying bishop but the resulting weakness of his kingside would be a problem. } ) 17.e5 $1 dxe5 18.Rxe5 Qf8 ( { This allows a weakening of Black's kingside but it may be the best of a bad job: } 18...c6 { would prevent the deadly threat of Nd5 but } 19.Ne4 { is still very strong } ) ( 18...g5 { is still a possibility but with the same drawbacks as before. } ) 19.Bxf6 gxf6 20.Re2 Qg7 21.Bxe6 Rxe6 22.Rxe6 fxe6 23.Rd3 Kh8 24.Rg3 Qh7 25.Qd2 { [diagram] [With a series of straightforward moves, White has established a clear positional advantage. Black's queen is overworked trying to defend the vulnerable and Black now tries to get his poorly-placed bishop back into the game.] } 25...Bc5 26.Ne4 Be7 27.Rh3 $1 { [diagram] } 27...Kg7 $2 ( { Of course not } 27...Qxe4 $2 { when } 28.Qxh6+ { soon leads to mate, but the text also has a tactical flaw } ) ( 27...Rd8 28.Rxh6 Rxd2 29.Rxh7+ Kxh7 30.Nxd2 { is better but leaves White a pawn up in a probable winning endgame. } ) ( 27...Kg8 28.Qf4 f5 29.Rxh6 Qg7 30.Rh3 { also costs Black a pawn. } ) 28.Qd7 $1 Kf7 ( 28...Qxe4 { loses to } 29.Qxe7+ Kg6 30.Rg3+ Kf5 31.Qh7+ Ke5 32.Re3 { , etc. } ) 29.Ng5+ $1 ( { Computers point out that } 29.Nxf6 $1 { is similarly lethal. } ) 29...fxg5 30.Rf3+ Kg8 31.Qxe6+ Kh8 32.Rf7 Bd6 ( { If the queen flees with } 32...Qd3 { , } 33.Qxh6+ { and mate next move. } ) 33.Rxh7+ Kxh7 34.Qf7+ Kh8 35.g3 Ra6 ( 35...Rf8 36.Qg6 Rxf2 37.Qxh6+ Kg8 38.Qxg5+ { and the kingside pawns will decide. } ) 36.Kb1 Bb4 37.f4 gxf4 38.gxf4 1-0
